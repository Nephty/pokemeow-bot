## USE AT YOUR OWN RISKS - How to use
You must change the coordinates variables in the first lines of the code so that they match the right coordinates on your screen. To see the coordinates of a pixel, open a terminal, type `python` to open the interpreter and type `import pyautogui` then `pyautogui.mouseInfo()`. You should only modify coordinates that stand in the 'else' statement.
